When kids engage in building blocks play, they are required to manipulate and grasp small objects, which helps to develop their hand-eye coordination and dexterity. By stacking blocks and connecting pieces together, children also improve their fine motor skills and hand muscles, which are crucial for activities such as writing, drawing, and tying shoelaces."
